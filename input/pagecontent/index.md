### Scope

Specify HL7 FHIR logical models and profiles to be used within the
European project [GATEKEEPER](https://www.gatekeeper-project.eu/) for
supporting the GATEKEEPER HEALTHCARE SPACE, where intuitive and
self-configuring dashboards, intelligent services for early risk
detection and care plans, and a federated data infrastructure are
provided to healthcare professionals.

This guide is developed as part of the Gatekeeper WP3 - Gatekeeper Web
of Things (WOT) Reference Architecture.

### Introduction

GATEKEEPER is a European Multi Centric Large-Scale Pilot on Smart Living
Environments. The main objective is enabling the **creation of a
platform that connects healthcare providers, businesses, entrepreneurs,
and elderly citizens** and the communities they live in, in order to
originate an open, trust-based arena for matching ideas, technologies,
user needs and processes, aimed at ensuring healthier independent lives
for the ageing populations.

The creation of the platform, is supported by the following specific
objectives, summarized in figure 1, including the delivery of:

  - the delivery of the GATEKEEPER DIGITAL PLATFORM implemented through
    fault tolerant, secure, flexible and scalable micro-services
    infrastructure, based on open source and data standards, built on
    top of reference W3C-Web of Things architectural models and
    including services referred to the health domain through
    **HL7-FHIR** and to the home domain through SAREF.

  - the delivery of the GATEKEEPER HEALTHCARE SPACE, where intuitive and
    self-configuring dashboards, intelligent services for early risk
    detection and care plans, and a federated data infrastructure are
    provided to healthcare professionals.

  - The execution of a series of PILOTS to demonstrate the effect,
    benefit, value and scalability of the GATEKEEPER solutions around
    REFERENCE USE CASES COVERING PRIMARY, SECONDARY and TERTIARY
    PREVENTION, initially deployed in 8 regions of 7 European countries.

  - The implementation of a STANDARDIZATION STRATEGY that allow the
    GATEKEEPER solution to be aligned with SDOs around legal and privacy
    aspects, healthcare, ageing, homes, cities and energies, IoT, Big
    Data and other Key Enabling Technologies, as well as value-based
    procurement.
